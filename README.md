# student-s-course

This program has a student class that stores two parameters hours per semester (semesterHours) and average grade (GPA).
In the main function, I created two objects "t" and "s" (two metaphorical students) to one (s) by default, all parameters are set inside the program,
and the parameters for student t are asked from the user. Also, inside the Student class, 
I created a member function (method) to add new courses to the student (there is a bug with counting semesterHours in this function,
I will try to fix this annoying phenomenon later).

You can simply copy my main file to yourself to check and refine the program by simply copying its code into your project.
Or use git.clone and the link https://github.com/Vasiliii/student-s-course.git.

You also can just download my .exe file from yandex.disk at the link https://disk.yandex.ru/d/pdB33rR3QSBMXg
